        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Recipe for the homey and beloved Americanized version of a classic Italian dish</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>(optional) 12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, 
                and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al 
                dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, 
                and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. 
                Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. 
                When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. 
                Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. 
                Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. 
                Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. 
                When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, 
                then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.</li>
            <li>Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. 
                Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.</li>
        </ol>
